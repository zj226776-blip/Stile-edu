1. **Unzip** this folder on your computer.
2. Go to your GitHub repository.
3. **Upload the CONTENTS** of this folder (files like `package.json`, `index.html`, and the `src` folder) — NOT the zip file itself.

## 🚀 How to Publish (Make it a Website)

Once your code files are on GitHub:

1. Go to **[Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**.
2. Sign up/Log in with GitHub.
3. Click **"Add New Project"** and select your repository (`Stile-edu`).
4. **Important (For the AI to work):** 
   - Open the "Environment Variables" section.
   - Key: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `(Your Gemini API Key)`
5. Click **Deploy**.

Vercel will build the website and give you a public link (e.g., `stile-edu.vercel.app`) that works on Google and Edge!
